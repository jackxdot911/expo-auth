# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Manual Configuration:

    If you still do not see the prompts to enter your Client ID and Secret during the amplify update auth, you can manually add these credentials in your Amplify configuration files:
        Navigate to your amplify/backend/auth/<auth_resource_name>/parameters.json file.
        Add or update the fields for your social provider credentials like this:

        json

        {
          "OAuth": {
            "WebDomain": "your_app.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com",
            "AppClientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
            "AppClientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
            "SignInRedirectURI": "myapp://",
            "SignOutRedirectURI": "myapp://"
          }
        }

    After making changes in the parameters file, run amplify push to deploy the changes.
